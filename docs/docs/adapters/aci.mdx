# Cisco ACI adapter

## What is Cisco ACI?

The *Cisco ACI* is a software-defined networking (SDN) solution that provides a policy-based, application-centric approach to managing and orchestrating network infrastructure. 
It is designed to improve the scalability, flexibility, and security of data center networks.

## Sync direction

Cisco ACI â†’ Infrahub

:::note
Currently, the Cisco ACI adapter supports only **one-way synchronization** from ACI to Infrahub.  
Syncing data back into ACI is not yet supported.

Although ACI data cannot be edited, additional information such as **`Device Attributes`** and **`Site Separation`** rules can be updated from Infrahub data.
