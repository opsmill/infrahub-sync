# Creating a new sync instance

This guide will walk you through the steps to create a new sync instance for infrahub-sync, allowing you to synchronize data between your source and destination systems efficiently.

## Step 1: Define your configuration

Start by defining your synchronization requirements in a YAML configuration file.

:::info

- The `name` key in the destination model corresponds to the Infrahub attribute.
- The `mapping` key in the destination model corresponds to the key in the IP Fabric payload to use.
- If `reference` is used, it links to a model that has been synchronized prior to this model.

:::

Here's an example configuration for syncing data from Nautobot to Infrahub:

In this example, consider that `device_type` and  `manufacturer` are Attribute of InfraDevice, if you are using another object with a Relationship, you would need to first import those objects and then referenced them (like InfraDevice in InfraInterface)

```yaml
---
name: example-sync-task

source:
  name: nautobot
  settings:
    url: "https://nautobot.example.com"
    token: "NAUTOBOT_TOKEN" # This can also be loaded from environment variables

destination:
  name: infrahub
  settings:
    url: "https://infrahub.example.com"
    token: "INFRAHUB_API_TOKEN" # This can also be loaded from environment variables


order:
  - "InfraDevice"
  - "InfraInterface"

schema_mapping:
  - name: InfraDevice
    mapping: "dcim.devices"
    identifiers: ["name"]
    fields:
      - name: "name"
        mapping: "name"
      - name: "device_type"
        mapping: "device_type.display_name"
      - name: "manufacturer"
        mapping: "device_type.manufacturer.name"

  - name: InfraInterface
    mapping: "dcim.interfaces"
    identifiers: ["device", "name"]
    fields:
      - name: "name"
        mapping: "name"
      - name: "interface_type"
        static: "10gbe"
      - name: "description"
        mapping: "description"
      - name: "device"
        reference: "InfraDevice"
```

For more information on customizing your sync configuration and troubleshooting, see the [Sync Instance configuration reference](../reference/config)

## Step 2: Generate the associated files

`infrahub-sync` relies on additional Python files, but these can be generated automatically from `config.yml`.

To generate the necessary models, run:

```bash
infrahub-sync generate --name example-sync-task
```

## Step 3: Run the sync

To synchronize data from IP Fabric to Infrahub, use the following command:

```bash
infrahub-sync sync --name example-sync-taskc
```
